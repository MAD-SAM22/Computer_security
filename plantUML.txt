actor User
participant "AES Algorithm" as AES
participant "Key Expansion" as KE

User -> AES: Provide plaintext (128 bits) and secret key
AES -> KE: Expand the key
KE -> AES: Round keys K_r

AES -> AES: AddRoundKey (Initial Round)
note right: S(x) = P XOR K_0

loop Main Rounds (1 to Nr - 1)
    AES -> AES: SubBytes
    AES -> AES: ShiftRows
    AES -> AES: MixColumns
    AES -> AES: AddRoundKey (K_r)
end

AES -> AES: Final Round (No MixColumns)
AES -> User: Output ciphertext block
